Convert yourself into a small business card and despair at how easily your life can be summed up!
Let go of your anxieties and let the *process* take control.

## Tech Stack

**redwoodjs**: React,GraphQL,Prisma,Jest,Storybook
## Why

When asked to make something I was passionate about I came up with a blank.
I did not care at the time about anything other than being employed. Then it hit me...
I truly despise the job hunt process. I realized at that moment I had to design something to fix that problem.
We all dislike the difficulties of finding the right job. 
Between the lies and ridiculous demands the recruiter has as requirements, and the dancing monkey routine we have to do to stand out.
It is just the worst. I thought to myself why not try to make the process as objective as possible.

## On the Journey
Going into this project with only React experience I was amazed at how  fast redwoodjs gets you up and running.
It was extremely enjoyable learning Graphql and Prisma. also testing was a thing.

## ToDo
1 Allow users to see their created cards.
2 Stop people from favoriting cards more than once.
3 Build the rest of the enterprise solution this small app fits into $$$$
